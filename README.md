## Introduction ℹ

For this course we were given the task to create something for one specific user. This had to be based on three phases consisting of a prototype and testing that protoype with the user. We were given a random case (Someone with a specific kind of disability) and we had to create this website for that someone.

## Problem ⁉

I was given a client called Larissa Klaassen. Larissa is blind/ very badly sighted and during investigation on her I found out she can only see about 95% meaning she can tell the difference between light and dark. Larissa is a professional Track cyclist and has won gold at the Paralympics in Tokyo 2020. We had to create a sport schedule for her based on her needs. I am going to focus on creating a easily accessible and usable schedule. SInce Laissa is blind, she uses a screenreader and tab to naviagte websites. She showed us how she used the web and we were given very big insights. If something went wrong, she would have to use the magnifying function to see what everything says and this function is a pain in the ass to use. It was our job to make it way easier for her to use the web and make it so she doesn't have to use this function.

## Prototyping , Testing and Results

## Phase 1️⃣

### Prototyping ✏

The first prototype was very simple, we had a short amount of time and the goal of the first phase was to really get to know Larissa and learn her needs. I created a simple tab function with divs to see what she could see and whether or not she liked the tab functions. Having a black background and white blocks to make them pop.

### Testing ☁

When Larissa came to us for the interviews I was already surprised by how well she functioned with how she moved around. It was almost as if she were not blind. But for the first interview asked a lot of questions and showed my prototype. She reacted well to it and I knew I could go further with it.

### Results ✅

- contrast en visueel vind ze fijn
- weekelijks in detail
- krachttraining en baantraining zijn belangrijk
- geen gedeelde, liever prive schema
- winnen sws (geen andere dames in nederland)
- Geen voedings schema
- oranje is lievelingskleur (blauw)
- ze heeft MAC
- Liever Nederlands en TAB ipv Pijltjes

Hoe ziet een ideale schema eruit?

- ma do kracht
- di start training vind ze kut
- de rest afstemmen
- kracht training op gevoel
- waarom doen we dingen? (krachttraining)
- houd alles bij in dr hoofd
- meer ordeningu
- logische duidelijkheid
- warming up - kern deel - cooling down
- baan seizoen okt - wk (wisseld wanneer)
- weg seizoen
- schema per wedstrijden (NK, WK, etc.)

### Take Away

## Phase 2️⃣

### Prototype ✏

The second prototype consisted of a more in-depth version of the schedule with more information to show her. Having a live updated schedule that is connected to the actual calendar and show the correct dates on their corresponding weekdays. The colours were the same but i didn’t manage to get the tab functions to work good yet.

### Testing ☁

Testing went very good, Larissa liked it and of course she wanted the tab functions to work better but that will be fixed. Furthermore, another student had Nonsense in her website and wanted to know whether or not she liked it. Larissa stated that she didn’t really like nonsense since when she is on the tracks she wants it to be quick and not have some nonsense in between.

### Results ✅

- tab functie moet worden verbeterd
- Geen nonsense, vind het onnodig en niet fijn
- Claire (vrouwelijke dames stem)
- snel info nodig

### Take Away

## Phase 3️⃣

### Prototype ✏

Phase 3 was the last time we got to interview her and again it went very well. I showed her my almost final prototype which included the correct tab functions and had every function i wanted in there.

### Testing ☁

She liked it and only wanted some things to be adjusted like more space in between the boxes so she could tell that she was moving from block to block. As well as some text changes like (terug => vorige maand, volgende => volgende maand) etc.

### Results ✅

- volgende en vroige maand
- meer ruimte tussen de blokjes
- dat die ook de dag zegt bij datum!
- knop voor ga naar vandaag misschien ergens anders? voor nu goed

### Take Away

## Adjustments made from interview

After all the interviews it was time to finalise the product, i didn’t have to change much so i did a few adjustments to the styling and added a few more functions like a ‘back to today’ button.

## Design Principles

### Study Situation 💻

To understand how Larissa works we need to study her and her situation, since she has a very special way of going about doing things. It is very important to understand her situation when applying it to her own personal needs. During our interviews we asked her a lot of questions regarding her ways of using the web, but also just the way she does things in general. Having a disability can prove to be a struggle and we need to learn from her in order to implement and make it accesible for more people.

### Prioritise Identity 🆔

From the interviews it is very clear that she has a very strong personality, she can be quite stubborn and stick to her ways. She is a very chaotic person mentioning to us the way she lives and doesnt like being controlled by a schedule and a coach. These things were kept in mind when designing this schedule for her, she doesnt like having a shared schedule and this proves in her proffesional live as well. She never follows her training schedules and wants to do what she wants.I therefore made it so that she can very easily add activities to her schedule and delete them as well. Keeping it personal for her.

### Ignore Conventions 🚫

- The usual text size has been decreased and increased at some points.
- the visual styling has been adjusted to her directly and doesnt look pleasing for people who can see. Using black as a background and white on the blocks we create a lot of contrast so that even she can see even a little bit.
- we didnt use a nav and these types of html tags so that the screenreader reads things out in her prefered way.
- Placing a tabindex on almost everything in a certain order so that I have control over how the tab moves.

### Add Nonsense 🎨

I didnt use any nonsense because Larissa has mentioned herself during one of the interviews that she didnt want nonsense in there. It would be to unneccesary when she just wants to quickly see certain things and not be filled with nonsense.
