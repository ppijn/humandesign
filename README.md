## Introduction
For this course we were given the task to create something for one specific user. This had to be based on prototyping and testing using these interviews. We were given a random case ( a person with a specific kind of disability) and we had to create this website for that person.

## Problem
I was given a client called Larissa Klaassen. Larissa is blind/ very badly sighted and can only see about 95% meaning she can tell the difference between light and dark. Larissa is a professional Track cyclist and has won gold at the Paralympics in Tokyo 2020. We had to create a sport schedule for her based on her needs. I am going to focus on creating a easily accessible and usable schedule. 

## Prototyping , Testing and Results

## Phase 1
### Prototyping
The first prototype was very simple, we had a short amount of time and the goal of the first phase was to really get to know Larissa and learn her needs. I created a simple tab function with divs to see what she could see and whether or not she liked the tab functions. Having a black background and white blocks to make them pop.

### Testing
When Larissa came to us for the interviews I was already surprised by how well she functioned with how she moved around. It was almost as if she were not blind. But for the first interview asked a lot of questions and showed my prototype. She reacted well to it and I knew I could go further with it.

### Results
- contrast en visueel vind ze fijn
- weekelijks in detail
- krachttraining en baantraining zijn  belangrijk
- geen gedeelde, liever prive schema
- winnen sws (geen andere dames in nederland)
- Geen voedings schema
- oranje is lievelingskleur (blauw)
- ze heeft MAC
- Liever Nederlands en TAB ipv Pijltjes
  
Hoe ziet een ideale schema eruit?
- ma do kracht
- di start training vind ze kut
- de rest afstemmen
- kracht training op gevoel
- waarom doen we dingen? (krachttraining)
- houd alles bij in dr hoofd
- meer ordeningu
- logische duidelijkheid
- warming up - kern deel - cooling down
- baan seizoen okt - wk (wisseld wanneer)
- weg seizoen
- schema per wedstrijden (NK, WK, etc.)


## Phase 2
### Prototype
The second prototype consisted of a more in-depth version of the schedule with more information to show her. Having a live updated schedule that is connected to the actual calendar and show the correct dates on their corresponding weekdays. The colours were the same but i didn’t manage to get the tab functions to work good yet.

### Testing
Testing went very good, Larissa liked it and of course she wanted the tab functions to work better but that will be fixed. Furthermore, another student had Nonsense in her website and wanted to know whether or not she liked it. Larissa stated that she didn’t really like nonsense since when she is on the tracks she wants it to be quick and not have some nonsense in between.

### Results
- tab functie moet worden verbeterd
- Geen nonsense, vind het onnodig en niet fijn
- Claire (vrouwelijke dames stem)
- snel info nodig

## Phase 3
### Prototype 
Phase 3 was the last time we got to interview her and again it went very well. I showed her my almost final prototype which included the correct tab functions and had every function i wanted in there. 

### Testing
She liked it and only wanted some things to be adjusted like more space in between the boxes so she could tell that she was moving from block to block. As well as some text changes like (terug => vorige maand, volgende => volgende maand) etc. 

### Results
- volgende en vroige maand 
- meer ruimte tussen de blokjes 
- dat die ook de dag zegt bij datum!
- knop voor ga naar vandaag misschien ergens anders? voor nu goed 

## Adjustments made from interview
After all the interviews it was time to finalise the product, i didn’t have to change much so i did a few adjustments to the styling and added a few more functions like a ‘back to today’ button.
